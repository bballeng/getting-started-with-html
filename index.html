    <p><b>Important Concepts</b></p> 

<p><b>About the web</b></p>
<p>A web browser allows a user to make request to servers using HTTP protocol.  Servers respond to the requests with the selected HTML files that the browser displays.  The web is a collection of HTML documents.</p>


<p><b>HTML</b></p>
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the basis of any webpage.  The <b>text</b> is what is displayed on a webpage and the <b>markup</b> is what the content looks like or how it is arranged.  HTML also has references to other documents such as images or videos.

<p><b>HTML Markup</b></p>
<b>Elements</b> are composed of opening and closing tags.<br>
<b>anchor (a)</b> tags make links.<br>
<b>image (img) </b> tags are used for displaying images.
The alternate text is required. It is the text that is displayed if a url does not exist.
Images do not have closing tags because it does not have content,this is called a <b>void</b> tag.


<p>All <b>whitespace</b> (tabs, paragraphs, spaces) in HTML turn into a single space when displayed on a webpage.</p>

<p><b>Inline elements</b>- just text<br>
An example of an inline element is a <b>break (br)</b> tag that is used to create a line break (it is a voidtag).<br></p>

<p><b>Block elements</b>â€“makes invisible boxes around content<br>
An example of a block element is a <b>paragraph (p)</b> tag, it is <em>not</em> a void tag, and it can also be used to create a break.<br></p>
